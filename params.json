These models can then be used for assessment of differential expression between groups of cells, as well as other types of analysis. The `scde` package also contains the `pagoda` framework which applies pathway and gene set overdispersion analysis to identify aspects of transcriptional heterogeneity among single cells. \r\n  \r\nThe overall approach to the differential expression analysis is detailed in the following publication:  \r\n[\"Bayesian approach to single-cell differential expression analysis\" (Kharchenko PV, Silberstein L, Scadden DT, Nature Methods, doi:10.1038/nmeth.2967)](http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v11/n7/abs/nmeth.2967.html)\r\n\r\nThe overall approach to pathways and gene set overdispersion analysis is detailed in the following publication:\r\n\"Characterizing transcriptional heterogeneity through pathway and gene set overdispersion analysis\" (Fan J, Salathia N, Liu R, Kaeser G, Yung Y, Herman J, Kaper F, Fan JB, Zhang K, Chun J, and Kharchenko PV) COMING SOON!\r\n\r\n# Sample analyses and images\r\n\r\n## Single cell error modeling\r\n<table>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td width=400px>\r\n      <img src=\"https://github.com/hms-dbmi/scde/raw/master/vignettes/figures/pagoda-cell.model.fits-0.png\" width=\"400px\">\r\n    </td>\r\n    <td>\r\n      <code>scde</code> fits individual error models for single cells using counts derived from single-cell RNA-seq data to estimate drop-out and amplification biases on gene expression magnitude.\r\n    </td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n## Differential expression analysis\r\n<table>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td width=250px>\r\n      <img src=\"https://github.com/hms-dbmi/scde/raw/master/vignettes/figures/scde-diffexp3-1.png\" width=\"250px\">\r\n    </td>\r\n    <td>\r\n      <pre>\r\n             lb   mle     ub    ce     Z    cZ\r\nDppa5a    8.075 9.965 11.541 8.075 7.160 5.968\r\nPou5f1    5.357 7.208  9.178 5.357 7.160 5.968\r\nGm13242   5.672 7.681  9.768 5.672 7.159 5.968\r\nTdh       5.829 8.075 10.281 5.829 7.159 5.968\r\nIft46     5.435 7.366  9.217 5.435 7.150 5.968</pre>\r\n      <br>\r\n      <code>scde</code> compares groups of single cells and tests for differential expression, taking into account variability in the single cell RNA-seq data due to drop-out and amplification biases in order to identify more robustly differentially expressed genes. \r\n    </td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n## Pathway and gene set overdispersion analysis\r\n<table>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td width=400px>\r\n      <img src=\"https://github.com/hms-dbmi/scde/raw/master/vignettes/figures/pagoda-Screen_Shot_2015-06-07_at_4.53.46_PM.png\" width=\"400px\"> \r\n    </td>\r\n    <td>\r\n      <code>scde</code> contains <code>pagoda</code> routines that characterize aspects of transcriptional heterogeneity in populations of single cells using pre-defined gene sets as well as 'de novo' gene sets derived from the data.
