\title{Estimate effetive number of cells based on lambda1 of random gene sets}
\usage{
pagoda.effective.cells(pwpca, start = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{pwpca}{result of the pagoda.pathway.wPCA() call with n.randomizations>1}

\item{start}{optional starting value for the optimization (if the nls breaks, trying high starting values usually fixed the local gradient problem)}
}
\value{
effective number of cells
}
\description{
Examines the dependency between the amount of variance explained by the first principal component
of a gene set and the number of genes in a gene set to determine the effective number of cells
for the Tracy-Widom distribution
}
